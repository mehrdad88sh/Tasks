<h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <div>
        <p  class="block">this element is <strong>block</strong> display.
            Every element on a web page is a rectangular box.
            The display property determines how that rectangular box behaves.
            A block element is an element that takes up the fullest width available, with line breaks before and after.</p>
        <p  class="inline">this paragraph is <strong>inline</strong> display.
            An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary, and does not force line breaks.</p>
        <p  class="none">this paragraph is <strong>none</strong> display.
            display:none hides an element, so it does not take up any space.
            The element will be hidden, and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there.
            display:none hides an element, without holding a place for that element.</p>
        <p  class="hidden">this paragraph is <strong>hidden</strong> visibility.
            Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to "none" or the visibility property to "hidden".
            However, notice that these two methods produce different results:
            visibility:hidden hides an element, but it will still take up the same space as before.
            The element will be hidden, but it will still affect the layout.</p>
        <p  class="visible">this paragraph is <strong>visible</strong> visibility</p>
    </div>
